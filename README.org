* My personal blog

This blog can be built with:

#+begin_src sh
  make -C content
#+end_src

and served with:

#+begin_src sh
  python3 -m http.server -d public
#+end_src

Then it may be viewed in Firefox with:

#+begin_src sh
  firefox localhost:8000
#+end_src

* TODO Things to do

** DONE Add class property to nagivation links
CLOSED: [2024-12-19 Thu 03:14]

I can then customize them with CSS.

** TODO Add interesting CSS for directories

This might be possible with ~file-directory-p~ adding that specific attribute. Directories should be cool looking. Also see if you can include interesting bullets for files to simulate the tree-like structure more

** TODO Add title to navigation sidebar

Right now it is not clear what all that information is. Maybe adding a title would be useful. Or some other kind of divider from the main content.

** TODO Add colorized source code block export

To do this, the Emacs solutions won't work. Use either [[https://prismjs.com/][PrismJS]] (see also [[https://macarthur.me/posts/run-prism-js-server-side/][this blog post]]) or [[https://highlightjs.org/][highlight.js]].

** TODO nav sidebar folds onto content on small screens

To fix this, put the article content inside one div and the nav sidebar in another div. Right now everything is inside

#+begin_src html
  <div id="content" class="content">
#+end_src

which org-publish puts in.

** TODO Custom link types

I can add custom link types like ~img:~ and ~svg:~ that will compute the right amount of ~../~ needed to reach the root directory. See [[info:org#Adding Hyperlink Types][(org)Adding Hyperlink Types]].
