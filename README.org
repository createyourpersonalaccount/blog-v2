* My personal blog

This blog can be built with:

#+begin_src sh
  make -C content
#+end_src

and served with:

#+begin_src sh
  python3 -m http.server -d public
#+end_src

Then it may be viewed in Firefox with:

#+begin_src sh
  firefox localhost:8000
#+end_src

* TODO Things to do

** TODO Add class property to nagivation links

I can then customize them with CSS.

** TODO Add interesting CSS for directories

This might be possible with ~file-directory-p~ adding that specific attribute. Directories should be cool looking. Also see if you can include interesting bullets for files to simulate the tree-like structure more

** TODO Add title to navigation sidebar

Right now it is not clear what all that information is. Maybe adding a title would be useful. Or some other kind of divider from the main content.

** TODO Add colorized source code block export
